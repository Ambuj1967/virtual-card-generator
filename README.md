__Virtual Card Generator__ is a simple script that lets you create stripe and privacy virtual payment cards in bulk. This script aims to speed up the process of setting up for sneaker releases on sites like footlocker and yeezysupply.

# Getting Started

1. Install Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/) and be sure to add to path during installation.
Once you have installed Python, download the repository.

### Install
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Config.json
Once you install the repository, you will see a config.json file. This is where you will place your api keys from stripe and privacy. You can find your api keys by navigating to settings. It is pretty easy to find. If you have trouble, first google, then DM if you  still can't see it.

#### Running the script

Open CMD or Terminal depending on your OS and be sure you are inside of the project folder. Then type:

```python
python3 main.py
```

This will run the program. You will be prompted to select several options. The program guides you through each step.
